Hockeyjerseyoutlet filter is bork - producing way too many products
Filter out ALL kids stuff
RCS filter is including shitty stuff like pins
General:
- screening for non-jerseys that have "jersey" in product title is shit
- screening out jerseys from other sports (e.g. SVP carries soccer, Toronto carries Raptors etc)
- text classifier layer?

Dicks prices are not extracting properly - was missing price_formatter(), should be fixed now?
